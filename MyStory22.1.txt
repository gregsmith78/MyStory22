My name is Greg.  This is my story.  This is our first day of class
at devCodeCamp.  Our generation is called Flurine...not sure I spelled
that correctly, but that's how it will be spelt for now.

The purpose of this exercise is to get us familiar with gitHub.  Right now
we are working on making changes to a file and getting them posted on the
website.  Also, to get familiar with the commands such as git commit, git
pull origin master, git status, and git push origin master.  There are more
commands to know, but those are core commands we need to know.
